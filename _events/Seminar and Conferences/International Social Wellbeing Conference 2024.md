<blockquote>
<p>AGEING AND LONGEVITY: TOWARDS A MEANINGFUL RETIREMENT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ISWC 2024 gathers policymakers, industry players, academics, and the public
for shared discussions on trends, challenges, and innovative solutions
in the social protection landscape. The conference is an annual event organised
by the EPF in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance Malaysia, the
Implementation Coordination Unit of the Prime Minister’s Office, the International
Social Security Association (ISSA), and the ASEAN Social Security Association
(ASSA).</p>
<p>This year’s theme, "Ageing and Longevity: Towards a Meaningful Retirement,"
addresses issues that shape ageing and retirement, with a focus on income
security for the elderly. ISWC 2024 delves into the impacts of an ageing
population on productivity and the economy, while exploring policies and
infrastructure needed to support the elderly. &nbsp;The conference will
examine Malaysia's readiness for the demographic shift, particularly in
terms of financial security, mental wellbeing, and healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p>With diverse experts, policymakers, and stakeholders in social protection
convening at ISWC 2024, all participants will have the opportunity to exchange
insights, explore innovative approaches, and inspire proactive actions
to enhance the wellbeing of the elderly, families, and society.</p>
<p>Join us in paving the way to building a resilient and inclusive society
where everyone can live well and step into the golden years with dignity.</p>
