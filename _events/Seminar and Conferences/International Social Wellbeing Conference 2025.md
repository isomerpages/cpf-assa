<blockquote>
<p>LIVING TO A HUNDRED: ARE WE PREPARED?</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Ageing is no longer just about adding years to life - it is about making
those years meaningful, vibrant, and secure. But here's the big question: <strong>As we live longer, how will we afford retirement?</strong> Are
we truly prepared for a future where living up to a hundred is the norm?</p>
<p>With life expectancy rising and populations ageing at an unprecedented
rate, the world is at a turning point. The longevity revolution is here,
and it is reshaping <strong>everything </strong>- from financial security
and workforce dynamics to healthcare, innovation, and economic structures.
This is not just about challenges - it is about unlocking <strong>new opportunities</strong> in
the <strong>longevity economy</strong>, where ageing populations drive transformation,
business growth, and intergenerational collaboration</p>
<p>The International Social Wellbeing Conference 2025 (ISWC 2025) is more
than just a conference - it's a call to action. Under the theme "Living
to A Hundred: Are We Prepared?", we're bringing together global thought
leaders, policymakers and industry experts to explore how we can navigate
this new reality by:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rethinking retirement and financial security in a world of 100-year lifespan;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transforming ageing into an economic powerhouse through innovation and
workforce shift;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shaping policies and strategies for a more resilient and sustainable future;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harnessing intergenerational collaboration to build a thriving, inclusive&nbsp;society</p>
</li>
</ul>
